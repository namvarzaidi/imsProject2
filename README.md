# Inventory Management Syestm Project

An application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete customers, items, and orders from a connected database throught the use of CRUD functionalty.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Project created using
- MySQL workbench -  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ - 
- Git Bash - Terminal for interacting with, as well as version control software. - 
- Eclipse - IDE - Integrated Development Environment - https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ 
- Junit - 

```

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Fork Starter repository, use as a template and save as own repository.
2. Clone repository on to local system. Open git bash  terminal in local folder, and run 'git clone' followed by the SSH code that can be copied from github. Alternatively the HTTPS ur can be used from the same interface on github to smart import the repository through the Eclipse IDE. 
For smart import select FIle, import, git, smart import in the IDE, it will automatically detect the copied HTTPS url, continue through and it will clone the repository.
3.If cloned using the GIt bash terminal then, select file, open projects from file system and then navigate to the local folder where the repository was cloned.
4.In MySQL Workbench, select database, manage connections to establish the connection between the database and the IDE. Once the password is entered and the connection is succesful, in the IDE navigate to db. properties in the package explorer and enter the same password. Save and run the runner to establish the connection.

## Running the tests

Open code in your IDE of choice, right click the main project in the package explorer, select run coverage and junit test to run testing.

### Unit Tests 

Units tests is a testing approach that targets the fundamental bulding blocks of an appliction. Named as such that it proves an application works by checking it unit by unit.


### Integration Tests 

Integration tests, tests all units of code together.
